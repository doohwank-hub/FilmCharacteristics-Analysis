# Data Science Portfolio by Doohwan Kim
This repository contains my data science portfolio consisting of projects involving exploratory data analysis and machine learning algorithms.

## Exporatory Data Analysis
### Movie Recommendation Records Analysis
Cleaning, preparing, and exploring a movie dataset from a web-based recommender system MovieLens. I separate the datset into two groups: top 20% in terms of revenue
and bottom 20% in terms of revenue. Using foundational data analysis and visualizing packages from Python, I explore differences and commonalities of record attributes in both groups.

## K-Means Clustering
### Fundamental Analysis of S&P500 Stocks
Algorithm used: K-Means Clustering

Description: S&P500 stocks data pulled from IEXCloud API. Built upon K-folds Cross Validation, hyperparameter optimization, and robust scaling.

This repository contains my data science portfolio consisting of various parts of exploratory analysis, machine learning, and visualization. 

## Exporatory analysis
### Movie Recommendation Revenue Analysis
Cleaning, preparing, and exploring a movie dataset from a web-based recommender system MovieLens, I separate the datset into two groups: top 20% in terms of revenue
and bottom 20% in terms of revenue. Using foundational data analysis and visualizing packages from Python, I explore differences and commonalities of movie 
attributes in both groups.

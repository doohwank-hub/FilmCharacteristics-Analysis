# Data Science Portfolio by Doohwan Kim
This repository contains my data science portfolio consisting of projects involving exploratory data analysis and machine learning algorithms.

## Exporatory Data Analysis
### Movie Recommendation Records Analysis
Cleaning, preparing, and exploring a movie dataset from a web-based recommender system MovieLens. I separate the datset into two groups: top 20% in terms of revenue
and bottom 20% in terms of revenue. Exploring the differences and commonalities of record attributes in both groups using NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

## K-Means Clustering
### Fundamental Analysis of S&P500 Stocks
Algorithm used: K-Means Clustering
Using NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn with S&P500 financial data pulled from IEXCloud API.
